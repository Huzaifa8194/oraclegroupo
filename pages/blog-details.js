                      <strong>From Local Lawns to Global Ventures</strong>
                      <br/><br/>
                      
                      Lorne’s entrepreneurial journey began with simple yet
                      foundational tasks like delivering newspapers and bagging
                      groceries, where he developed a strong work ethic and
                      valuable business skills. From cutting grass and clearing
                      snow to leading large-scale projects, Lorne’s ability to
                      spot and seize opportunities has been a key driver of his
                      success.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Lorne’s passion for property development came to life with
                      the creation of Agua de Lechuga, a condo-hotel in
                      Guanacaste, Costa Rica. Through innovative marketing
                      strategies—such as launching a rental program and becoming
                      the first to sell condos on eBay internationally—he
                      transformed this project into a global success.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Building on that success, Lorne expanded his real estate
                      investments, notably purchasing distressed properties
                      during the 2008 financial crisis. By personally renovating
                      these properties, he turned them into highly profitable
                      rental assets, amassing a multimillion-dollar portfolio
                      spanning Detroit, Florida, and Mexico.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Beyond his achievements in real estate, Lorne has embraced
                      the digital world as a crypto enthusiast and miner. His
                      passion for innovation allows him to merge traditional
                      investments with modern technology seamlessly.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Lorne also nurtures a love for cars, combining mechanical
                      knowledge with a passion for driving. Whether it’s real
                      estate development, cryptocurrency ventures, or personal
                      adventures, Lorne approaches each endeavor with
                      creativity, practicality, and an unwavering ambition to
                      succeed.

                    With over 60 years of experience in energy efficiency, power
                reliability, and technical consulting across 12 countries, Saul
                Stricker is a trailblazer in developing innovative solutions for
                energy optimization and infrastructure challenges.
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Career Highlights</strong>
                <br />
                Pioneering Interruptible Power Solutions: <br></br>While working
                with Ontario Hydro (now Hydro One) in Canada, Saul played a key
                role in designing a groundbreaking program for “interruptible
                power.” This initiative allowed the utility to optimize energy
                usage during off-peak periods by leveraging surplus
                hydroelectric power from Niagara Falls, enabling system
                expansion and reducing costs.
                <br />
                <br /> Global Impact in Energy Consulting:
                <br />
                Saul’s expertise has been sought worldwide. For instance, he was
                invited by the National Electric Utility of Egypt to address
                widespread blackouts impacting seven interconnected countries.
                His strategy to shift major loads to off-peak hours using
                interruptible power not only restored grid stability but also
                significantly lowered costs for both utilities and large-scale
                consumers.
                <br />
                <br />
                Policy Innovation for Energy Efficiency:
                <br /> Saul’s work in developing programs such as Canada’s
                ENERGUIDE Labeling Program has improved product efficiency and
                supported local manufacturing competitiveness. His ability to
                align energy strategies with economic growth makes his expertise
                particularly valuable in emerging markets, such as Paraguay,
                where his solutions could elevate manufacturing standards and
                reduce operational expenses.
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>Commitment to Service</strong>
                <br />
                <br />
                Beyond his professional achievements, Saul is deeply committed
                to giving back to communities and making a positive impact on
                humanity. His passion for innovative energy solutions is matched
                by his dedication to creating sustainable and equitable outcomes
                for people and businesses alike.
                <br />
                <br />
                Saul Stricker’s legacy is one of leadership, vision, and a
                relentless drive to advance energy efficiency on a global scale.
